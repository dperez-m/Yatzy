# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

This Refactoring Kata was designed by Jon Jagger and is available in his Cyber-Dojo. See [his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html)

It was changed a little by Emily Bache, so that the rules more closely match the original game.

## Kata Description

The problem that this code is designed to solve is explained here: [Yatzy](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/yatzy.html)

The idea is to refactor the project to learn how to do it in a practical way.
